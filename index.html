                            Hello everyone! Today, in our talk about dead languages, we will focus on a very interesting
                            case:
                            <strong>Mycenaean Greek</strong>. It’s not just that this old way of speaking disappeared;
                            its loss had huge
                            results for the entire Greek civilization that came later, pushing it into what we call the
                            Dark Age.
                            But before we talk about its death, we need to understand what made it alive.

                            wasn't like the writing we use today. It was a highly specialized tool used almost
                            exclusively by palace
                            scribes for administrative records—counting sheep, jars of oil, and weapons.

                                Unlike the modern alphabet where one letter equals one sound, Linear B was a

                                Each symbol represented a syllable (like da, de, di, do, du).

                                "King" in Classical Greek is <em>Basileus</em>, but in Mycenaean, it was

                    This is tricky because Linear B was used for accounting, not romance. We have lists of chariots, but

                    When the palaces collapsed, the paperwork system (Linear B) vanished. The general population never

                    so the script died with the scribes. This started the <strong>Greek Dark Age</strong>: 400 years

                    For centuries, Linear B was a mystery. It wasn't until 1952 that an English architect named
                    <strong>Michael Ventris</strong> cracked the code.
                    He realized it wasn't a separate language, but an early form of Greek! This discovery rewrote the
                    history books, proving Greek civilization was much older than previously thought.

                    The Dark Age wasn't a total pause, but a time of rebuilding. By the 8th century BC, Greeks adopted
                    the Phoenician alphabet,
                    added vowels, and created a new writing system. This innovation ended the Dark Age and laid the
                    groundwork for the rise of Classical Greece.
